# NDatabase
Fork of CodePlex version
http://ndatabase.codeplex.com/

I've forked this in an attempt to keep this project alive.  The main version hasn't been updated now for a few years. NDatabase is an
easy to use NoSQL database.  It always easy file based storage and querying of any class in your assembly.  I've used to for many 
small web application that need a quit way to store and retrieve objects with out having to setup a SQL database.

See NDatabase.PDF for documentation
